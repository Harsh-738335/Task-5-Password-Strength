## Final Combined Feedback (for All 5 Passwords)

- The five passwords evaluated — 72HsR@a#!93, 73@A#2zHarS:W&, @#$60Ag*aSh!^R, WzQ@7#2$^B!:H, and HAGsh3@#$%DU>{""?>HGYC — all demonstrate strong adherence to modern password security standards.
- Each one contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and multiple special characters, with no recognizable patterns or dictionary-based content.
- The lengths range from 11 to 22 characters, providing increasing levels of entropy and resistance to brute-force attacks.
- The final two passwords are exceptionally long and symbol-heavy, making them extremely difficult to crack and suitable for highly sensitive environments.
- Overall, these passwords reflect best practices in password creation — combining length, randomness, and character diversity — and are appropriate for securing personal, financial, and administrative-level accounts.

## Common Attack Methods

- Brute Force: Defeated by long, high-entropy passwords  
- Dictionary Attack: Useless against random & symbol-heavy passwords  
- Hybrid Attack: Fails due to randomness and symbol insertion
